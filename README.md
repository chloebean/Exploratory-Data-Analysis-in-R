# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-R

The dataset movies_withNullValues.csv has data related to movies released in different years. You will have to give the
1. Summative Analysis describing the number of
  a. Columns
  b. rows
  c. names of different columns
  d. The class types of the columns
  
2. Check the Data Quality of the data. If you realize there are null values in it, use Data Imputation for filling the data. Justify the methodology you follow for Data Imputaion.

3. Do Univariate Analysis of all the variables present

4. The target variable in this dataset is the attribute named “binary” which has two predefined variables FAIL and PASS. Do a bivariate analysis of this variable with all the other attributes. Also give your inferences from the graph generated.

5. Draw a multivariate graph for all the variables

6. Also draw a graph between year and budget 7. Apply PCA on this dataset after removing categorical variables 8. After applying PCA, draw inferences from the Principal Components generated using appropriate plots. Describe your inferences
